config MTK_GPU_SUPPORT
	tristate "Support MTK GPU"
	help
	  config supports MTK GPU driver
	  CONFIG_MTK_GPU_SUPPORT defines
	  The gpu driver would be built-in, as kernel module or not supported
	  MTK_GPU_VERSION would define the target HW IP

config MTK_GPU_VERSION
	string "Support MTK GPU Driver Version"
	default ""
	help
	  CONFIG_MTK_GPU_VERSION define which gpu ddk version will be used
	  It has three parts
	  1.vendor name 2.GPU architecture name 3. driver version

config MTK_GPU_COMMON_DVFS_SUPPORT
	bool "Support GPU VSync-Based DVFS Policy"
	default n
	help
	  config supports to enable GPU DVFS policy.
	  It is nice method to save power.
	  It is recommended to enable it when MTK_GPU_SUPPORT is enabled.

config MTK_GPU_R5P0
	bool "Force to use r5p0 driver"

config SW_SYNC64
	bool "Enable SW 64bit sync counter"
	depends on SW_SYNC
	help
	  A sync object driver that uses a 64bit counter to coordinate
	  syncrhronization.  Useful when there is no hardware primitive backing
	  the synchronization.

config MTK_GPU_SPM_DVFS_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable GPU SPM DVFS"
	default n
	help
	  Choose this option to enable a dedicated HW to do GPU DVFS.
	  The feature is still under experiment. Enable only if you know
	  what your are doing.
	  MTK_GPU_COMMON_DVFS_SUPPORT and MTK_GPU_SPM_DVFS_SUPPORT shouldn't
	  exist concurrently.
