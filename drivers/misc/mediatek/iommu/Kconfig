	  Choose this option to enable mediatek iommu debug driver.
	  According to the characteristic of hardware, we need to add
	  some debug information. For example translation fault, hardware
	  dump information and so on. In addition, for ion buffer, we can
	  use dma_buf information to monitor iova, but if user use
	  "dma_alloc_attrs" to allocate buffer, we can not monitor iova.
	  So we can use list to save all iova node and dump it.
