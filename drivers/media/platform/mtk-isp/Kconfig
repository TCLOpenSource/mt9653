	    Generic helpers for Mediatek SoCs ISP drivers. Mediatek
	    SoCs ISP drivers have similar image handling flow. For
	    example, Mediatek's ISP IPs may accept multiple input
	    buffers of a frame and generate multiple output buffers
	    of different format, size and effect. The helpers
	    provide the functions to create the common flow.

	    This feature will be removed in the upstream version
	    of Mediatek SoCs ISP drivers. It added some
	    abstraction implementing V4L2 and VB2 ops using
	    MTK-specific ops, which is not a discouraged pattern
	    of V4L2 drivers.

	    Choose y if you have drivers using the common utilities.

	    Camsys driver controls 3A (autofocus, exposure,
	    and white balance) with tuning feature and output
	    the first capture image buffer in Mediatek's camera system.

	    This driver also provides a mipi-csi2 host driver used as a
	    interface to connect camera with Mediatek's SOCs. It is able
	    to handle multiple cameras
	    simultaneously.

	    Choose y if you want to use Mediatek SoCs to create image
	    capture application such as video recording and still image
	    capture.
