Description
-----------

This is the driver for the I2C host controller of MediaTek DTV SOC chip mt5896.

Features
--------

This host controller have specific parameters
1. Start condition count, ie. clock(s) between SDA falling and SCL falling.
2. Stop condition count, ie. clock(s) between SCL rising and SDA rising
3. SDA hold time, ie. clock(s) between falling edge SCL and SDA output
4. Data latch timing
5. Scl stretch en/dis-able, this parameter only setup according dts property.

These parameters may setup by properties of device node in device tree or
attribute files in following path:
1. For start condition count:
	/sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-N/device/start_count
2. For Stop condition count:
	/sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-N/device/stop_count
3. For SDA hold time
	/sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-N/device/sda_count
4. For Data latch timing
	/sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-N/device/latch_count
5. For Scl stretch (read only for checking property)
	/sys/class/i2c-adapter/i2c-N/device/scl_stretch
