config MTK_CLK_BUFFER
	tristate "MediaTek Clock Buffer Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Clock Buffer
	  driver, which support interface for  PMIC 26Mhz output to
	  other HW component such as BB_MD/WCN/NFC/RF/UFS.
	  It could also control FPM/LPM mode switch state.

config MTK_CLKBUF_BBLPM
	bool "MediaTek Clock Buffer BBLPM Mode Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Clock Buffer
	  BBLPM, which support PMIC 26Mhz output transfer to low
	  power mode, less accurate with power consumption.
	  But with restrict condition for some of  XO_BUFFER need to
	  be disabled.

config MTK_CLKBUF_NFC
	bool "MediaTek Clock Buffer NFC Support"
	select REGMAP
	help
	  Say yes here to support for MediaTek Clock Buffer XO_NFC,
	  which support PMIC 26Mhz output to NFC HW component. If
