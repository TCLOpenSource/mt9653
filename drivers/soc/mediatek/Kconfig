	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Command Queue (CMDQ)
	  driver. The CMDQ is used to help read/write registers with critical
	  time limitation, such as updating display configuration during the
	  vblank.

	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek DVFSRC (dynamic voltage
	  and frequency scaling resource collector) found
	  on different MediaTek SoCs. The DVFSRC is a proprietary
	  hardware which is used to collect all the requests from
	  system and turn into the decision of minimum Vcore voltage
	  and minimum DRAM frequency to fulfill those requests.

	depends on ARCH_MEDIATEK || COMPILE_TEST
	depends on REGULATOR_MTK_DVFSRC
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Multimedia DVFS (MMDVFS)
	  driver. The MMDVFS is used to set clk for Mediatek multimedia hardwares
	  , such as display, camera, mdp and video codec. Say no if your device
	  does not need to do DVFS for Multimedia hardwares.

config MTK_IPI
	tristate "MediaTek IPI Support"
	depends on RPMSG_MTK
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek IPI between tinysys.
	  MTK IPI consists of APIs to do Linux to/from uP/DSP communication
	  based on rpmsg. Synchronization among tasks is also handled by
	  this layer. If uP/DSP drivers handle by themselves, they can use
	  rpmsg directly.

config MTK_MBOX
	tristate "MediaTek Mbox Support"
	help
	  Say yes here to add support for the MediaTek Mbox driver.
	  MTK MBOX is a physical H/W which consists of configurable 128
	  or 256 bytes SRAM and 32 bit irq. The driver does read/write
	  SRAM and IRQ handling.
