* MediaTek Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART)

Required properties:
- compatible should contain:
  * "mediatek_tv,ns16550" for MT5870 compatible UARTs

- reg: The base address of the UART register bank.

- interrupts:
  index 0: an interrupt specifier for the UART controller itself
  index 1: optional, an interrupt specifier with edge sensitivity on Rx pin to
           support Rx in-band wake up.

- clocks : Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  See ../clocks/clock-bindings.txt for details.

For compatibility with older device trees an unnamed clock is used for the
baud clock if the baudclk does not exist. Do not use this for new designs.

Example:

	uart0: serial@1f201300{
		compatible = "mediatek_tv,ns16550";
		reg = <0x0 0x1f201300 0 0x20>;
		current-speed = <115200>;
		device_type = "serial";
		clock-frequency = <123000000>;
		interrupt-parent = <&mtk_intc0>;
		interrupts = <0x0 0x0 0x4>;
		reg-shift = <3>;
		uart-device-id = <0>;
	};
